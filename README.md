# 📊 Custom Airtable App

This project is a **custom web application** built with **React** and powered by the **Airtable API (Builder Hub token)**.  
It displays records from an Airtable **Project Table** as interactive cards, making it easier to view project data outside of Airtable.

## 🎯 Objective

- Fetches records from Airtable via API (using Builder Hub token).
- Displays each record as a **card** containing all its information.
- Creates a **new card automatically** when a new record is added in Airtable.
- Highlights the **Status field** with colors:
  - ✅ Done → Green  
  - ⏳ In Progress → Orange  
  - 🚀 Not Started → Dodger Blue  
  - ⛔ Blocked → Dark Red
